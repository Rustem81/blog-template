# blog-template

A blog template built with Vue CLI, Vuex, Vue Router, and has a Firebase backend

Designed to be a reusable template that only needs some color/style changes, and some changes in the Firebase backend. Mobile friendly, with my personal design aesthetic.

To-do:

1. Header/navigation. Make it mobile friendly + desktop friendly. DONE!
2. Start basic logging in and out systems with Firebase. DONE!
3. Add authentication and prevent logged out user from accessing "write/create" or admin pages
4. Add post creation.
5. Add comments to posts.
6. ??
