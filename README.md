# blog-template

A blog template built with Vue CLI, Vuex, Vue Router, and has a serverless Firebase backend

Designed to be a reusable template that only needs some color/style changes, and some changes in the Firebase config file. Mobile friendly, with my personal design aesthetic.

To-do:

1. Header/navigation. Make it mobile friendly + desktop friendly. DONE!
2. Start basic logging in and out systems with Firebase. DONE!
3. Add authentication and prevent logged out user from accessing "write/create" or admin pages. DONE!
4. Retrieve posts. DONE!
5. Add specific post id + page routing, ie blog.com/posts/123456
6. Add post creation.
7. View and add comments to posts.
8. More to come???
